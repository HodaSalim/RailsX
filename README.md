# Rubyùïè - A Microservices-Based ùïè Clone

**Rubyùïè** is a clone of ùïè (formerly known as Twitter), built using Ruby on Rails, MySQL, Redis, and Sidekiq. This project serves as a microservices-based architecture practice and focuses on scalability and performance optimization through the use of background job processing, caching, and inter-service communication.

## Features

- User registration and authentication
- Posting text-based updates (tweets)
- Following and unfollowing users
- Real-time updates using Redis Pub/Sub
- Background job processing with Sidekiq (e.g., sending notifications, processing media)
- Microservices-based architecture

## Technologies

- **Ruby on Rails**: Web framework used for handling API requests and rendering pages.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for storing user data, tweets, and followers.
- **Redis**: In-memory data store used for caching and real-time updates.
- **Sidekiq**: Background job processor for handling long-running tasks such as notifications, user feed updates, and media processing.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Ruby (version 3.0+ recommended)
- MySQL
- Redis
- Sidekiq

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rubyx.git
   cd rubyx
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. Set up the database:

   ```bash
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
   ```

4. Configure Redis and Sidekiq:

   Update the `config/sidekiq.yml` file with your Redis configuration.

5. Start the Redis server:

   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```

6. Start the Sidekiq background worker:

   ```bash
   bundle exec sidekiq
   ```

7. Run the Rails server:

   ```bash
   rails s
   ```

## Running the App

Once the server is running, you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Microservices

- **User Service**: Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **Tweet Service**: Manages tweet creation, deletion, and interactions (likes, retweets).
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications when users are followed, mentioned, or liked.
- **Feed Service**: Responsible for generating and caching the user feed.

Each service communicates with others through APIs or background jobs via Sidekiq.
